# Player System - New Architecture

## ðŸŽ¯ **What PlayerCharacter.cs is Used For:**

`PlayerCharacter.cs` is the **main player implementation** that:

1. **Inherits from BaseCharacter** - Gets all core character functionality
2. **Implements all character interfaces** - IDamageable, IAttacker, IMovable, IAbilityUser, etc.
3. **Handles player-specific input** - Movement, combat, abilities
4. **Uses the new data architecture** - ScriptableObjects and CharacterPresets
5. **Manages experience and leveling** - Player progression system
6. **Coordinates all player systems** - Movement, combat, abilities, stats

## ðŸš€ **Current Player System (Clean & Modern):**

### **Core Scripts:**

- âœ… **`Player.cs`** - Single script solution (just add this one!)
- âœ… **`PlayerCharacter.cs`** - Main player implementation
- âœ… **`BaseCharacter.cs`** - Foundation for all characters
- âœ… **`CharacterStateMachine.cs`** - Simple state management

### **Data Architecture:**

- âœ… **`CharacterData.cs`** - Character stats and properties
- âœ… **`AbilityData.cs`** - Reusable ability system
- âœ… **`EquipmentData.cs`** - Equipment and items
- âœ… **`CharacterPreset.cs`** - Complete character configurations
- âœ… **`CharacterFactory.cs`** - Factory for creating characters

## ðŸŽ® **Super Simple Setup:**

### **Step 1: Add Player Script**

1. Create your player GameObject
2. Add **ONLY** the `Player.cs` script
3. Assign a `CharacterPreset` in the inspector
4. **Done!** Everything else is automatic

### **Step 2: Create Character Preset**

1. Right-click in Project â†’ Create â†’ Character â†’ Character Preset
2. Configure the preset with:
   - Character Data (stats, sprites, sounds)
   - Abilities (Shield Bash, Defensive Stance, Whirlwind)
   - Starting Equipment
3. Assign it to your Player script

## ðŸ”§ **How It Works:**

### **Player.cs (Single Script):**

- Automatically adds `PlayerCharacter` component
- Manages events and external communication
- Provides simple interface for other systems

### **PlayerCharacter.cs (Main Implementation):**

- Handles all player input and behavior
- Implements movement, combat, abilities
- Manages experience and leveling
- Uses data from CharacterPreset

### **BaseCharacter.cs (Foundation):**

- Provides all core character functionality
- Implements all character interfaces
- Handles stats, health, equipment, buffs
- Works for players, enemies, and NPCs

## ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits:**

### **âœ… No Redundancy:**

- Single, clean player system
- No duplicate functionality
- Clear separation of concerns

### **âœ… Data-Driven:**

- Easy to create new characters
- Designers can configure without coding
- Reusable across all character types

### **âœ… Professional Architecture:**

- Uses industry-standard patterns
- Interfaces for clean design
- ScriptableObjects for data management

### **âœ… Easy to Use:**

- Just add one script
- Assign a preset
- Everything works automatically

## ðŸŽ® **Controls:**

- **A/D**: Move left/right
- **Space**: Jump
- **Left Shift**: Dash
- **Left Click**: Attack
- **E**: Shield Bash
- **R**: Defensive Stance
- **T**: Whirlwind
- **Q**: Special Attack
- **L**: Gain Experience (debug)
- **H**: Heal (debug)

## ðŸ“š **Next Steps:**

1. **Create your first CharacterPreset**
2. **Test the player system**
3. **Create enemy presets** for your tower defense game
4. **Add equipment and progression**

This system is now clean, modern, and ready for your tower defense game!
